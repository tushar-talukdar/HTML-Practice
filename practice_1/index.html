            <h2>Bihu</h2>
            <p>
              Bihu (Assamese pronunciation: [bi'hu] ⓘ) is an important cultural
              festival unique to the Indian state of Assam[1] and is of three
              types – 'Rongali' or 'Bohag Bihu' observed in April, 'Kongali' or
              'Kati Bihu' observed in October or November, and 'Bhogali' or
              'Magh Bihu' observed in January.[2] The festivals present an
              admixture of Tibeto-Burman, Austroasiatic and Indo-Aryan
              traditions entwined so intricately that it is impossible to
              separate them[3]—festivals which are uniquely Assamese are ones to
              which all communities of Assam had contributed elements.[4] The
              Rongali Bihu is the most important of the three, celebrating
              spring festival. The Bhogali Bihu or the Magh Bihu is a harvest
              festival, with community feasts. The Kongali Bihu or the Kati Bihu
              is the sombre, thrifty one reflecting a season of short supplies
              and is an animistic festival.[5] The Rongali Bihu is the most
              important of them all, coincides with the Assamese New Year and as
              well as with other regions of Indian subcontinent, East Asia and
              South-East Asia, which follow the Hindu calendar and Buddhist
              calendar.[6] The other two Bihu festivals every year are unique to
              Assamese people. Like some other Indian festivals, Bihu is
              associated with agriculture, and rice in particular. Bohag Bihu is
              a sowing festival, Kati Bihu is associated with crop protection
              and worship of plants and crops and is an animistic form of the
              festival, while Bhogali Bihu is a harvest festival.[7][8] Assamese
              celebrate the Rongali Bihu with feasts, music and dancing. Some
              hang brass, copper or silver pots on poles in front of their
              house, while children wear flower garlands then greet the new year
              as they pass through the rural streets.[9] The three Bihu are
              Assamese festivals[9] elders in family, fertility and mother
              goddess, but the celebrations and rituals reflect influences from
              Southeast Asia and Sino-Tibetan cultures.[10][11][12] In
              contemporary times, the Bihus are celebrated by all Assamese
              people irrespective of religion, caste or creed.[13] It is also
              celebrated overseas by the Assamese diaspora community living
              worldwide. The term Bihu is also used to imply Bihu dance
              otherwise called Bihu Naas and Bihu folk songs also called Bihu
              Geet.

            <h2>History of Bihu</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Indigenous origin The word Bihu has been derived from the Deori (a
              Boro-Garo language) word Bisu which means "excessive joy".[14]
              Original form of Bihu continues among the Chutias, Sonowal
              Kacharis, Thengal Kacharis and Deoris. These groups, known as
              Sadiyal Kacharis were associated with the historical Kingdom of
              Sadiya.[15] The other branches of Bodo-Kacharis which include
              Boros, Dimasas, Rabhas, Tiwas, etc. have also been celebrating
              Bihu since ancient times. The Boros call it Baisagu, while the
              Dimasas, Tiwa and Rabha call it Bushu or Bushu
              Dima,[16][17][18][web 1]Pisu, Dumsi respectively.[19]
            </p>

            <p>
              local folklore, it is said that Bordoisila (Bardai Sikhla in Bodo)
              (meaning north-westerly winds in Assamese) was the daughter of God
              Earth who married to a bridegroom of some distant land. Bordoisila
              visits her mother's home once in year during spring time which
              indicates the beginning of Bihu and leaves after a few days which
              indicates the end of Bihu. Assam experience strong gale (wind) at
              that period which marks the beginning of Bihu and another strong
              gale after her departure which is devastating. The word Bordoisila
              is derived from the Bodo word Bordaisikhla which means "girl of
              storm" (Sikhla meaning girl and Bardai meaning storm). There is
              even a dance with the same name performed among Boro people during
              Baisagu which points to the origin of Bihu in the Bodo-Kachari
              groups.[web 2]
            </p>

            <p>
              Yet another reference of Bihu can be found in the Deodhai Buranji
              which mentions that the capital of the Chutia kingdom, Sadiya was
              suddenly attacked by the Ahom forces on the first day of Bihu/Bisu
              in 1524 (first Wednesday of Bohag/Vaisakha), when the people were
              busy celebrating Bihu. The Ahom general Phrasenmung Borgohain upon
              the advice of a Chutia general (who sided with the enemies) played
              the Bihu Dhul (on Ujha Bisu day i.e. 7th Bohag/Vaisakha) to trick
              the Chutias which ultimately led to their defeat.[20]
            </p>

            <p>
              In early texts, Bohag Bihu celebrations started from the first
              week of Chot in Assamese month. The period from the first week of
              Chaitra till the end was known as Raati Bihu or Chotor Bihu.
              During this period, young people danced at night in the grounds of
              the Than (temple). The last day of Chaitra or the first Tuesday of
              Bohag was when the Rati Bihu ended. This was known as the Uruka
              (derived from the Deori-Chutia Urukuwa meaning to end). The temple
              dancers Deodhani danced the entire night and were believed to be
              possessed by the goddess Kechai-khati (kolimoti), signaling that
              she had descended upon earth from heaven (Bihu nomai ona).
            </p>

            <pre>
        This belief of the goddess arriving during the Bihu season each year can still be found in Bihu songs as,

        "Kolimoti e bai ghuri Bohagoloi
        Ahibi ne nai?
        Ami thakim ami thakim
        Baatoloi sai."</pre
            >

            <p>
              The day after Uruka, i.e. the first Wednesday was celebrated as
              Goru Bihu. This tradition of cattle rites is same as that followed
              by the Boros in Bwisagu indicating the common roots of both the
              festivals. During the night of Goru-bihu, people danced Bihu in
              separate groups in the Thans where animal sacrifice took place.
              After the sacrifices to the goddess, the young folk visited the
              households of the village, which was the start of Husori. This old
              tradition of starting Husori from the temple is still followed by
              the Deoris, some Sonowals, Chutias and Morans as well as the
              people of Sadiya. In other communities, the temple has been
              replaced by the Namghar.[21] The festivities of Bohag Bihu
              continued for a week and ended with the rite by which the goddess
              was bid farewell. In this rite, a boat was first prepared out of
              banana stem and decorated with flowers and offerings. Then, it was
              carried to the banks of the river where a duck/chicken was put
              inside the boat and allowed to float as a symbol of sacrifice.
              After performing the rite, the people returned to their homes,
              singing along the way with the beats of the Dhul and the tunes of
              the Pepa.
            </p>

            <pre>
        Some old Assamese Bihu folklore still hint to this tradition.

        “Hasoti e chot Bisoti e chot.
        Budhe Goru Bihu Mangale Uruka.
        Bihu goi asili kot.”

     “Boge dhari khale luitor hihu,
      Mangal bare Uruka Budh bare Goru Bihu
    Tar pasor dina Manisor Bihu.”

    “Husori e chot asili kot.
    Sadiyar ahotor tolot,
    Husori e chot asili kot.
    Ami je ulomu jot Dubori nogoje tot.”

    “Kundilor agolit ukhokoi Himolu.
    Tate loi kuruwai bah.
    Sadiyar rajate sari haal goxani
    Taloi namaskar koru.
    Hunare jakhala Rupor hetamari
    Ahe sari haali nami.”</pre
